WARNING - DUE TO API CHANGES THIS WHOLE CODE IS NOW DEPRECATED - KEPT FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES ONLY

This was a twitter scraper created as part of a internal project. However given the API changes, this is no longer useful. Only reason i'm making the repository public is to allow a small portfolio visualization. Code is very old and would likely benefit from new passes (I was still learning, be patient ;-D).
